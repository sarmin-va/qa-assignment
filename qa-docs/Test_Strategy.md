# Test Strategy

## Objective
To ensure that all API endpoints function as expected and meet the specified requirements.

## Scope
- API endpoints to manage users:
    - **POST /users**: Create User
    - **GET /users/{userId}**: Retrieve User
    - **PUT /users/{userId}**: Update User
    - **DELETE /users/{userId}**: Delete User

## Testing Types and Approach

### Unit Testing
- **Objective**: Verify the smallest parts of the application (e.g., individual methods/functions).
- **Tools**: JUnit.
- **Approach**:
    - Write unit tests for validation logic (e.g., checking field length, email format).
    - Mock dependencies using Mockito to isolate the unit under test.
    - Ensure that each unit test focuses on a single functionality.

### Integration Testing
- **Objective**: Test the interaction between different components (e.g., controllers, services).
- **Tools**: RestAssured.
- **Approach**:
    - Validate that API endpoints interact correctly with other layers (e.g., services, databases).
    - Test using different input combinations to ensure robust error handling and correct data exchange.

### System Testing
- **Objective**: Perform end-to-end testing of the API endpoints.
- **Tools**: RestAssured, Postman.
- **Approach**:
    - Test the complete workflow from creating a user to retrieving, updating, and deleting.
    - Ensure that all business requirements are met and that all functionalities work together.

### User Acceptance Testing (UAT)
- **Objective**: Validate that the API meets user requirements and business objectives.
- **Tools**: Postman.
- **Approach**:
    - Collaborate with stakeholders to define UAT criteria.
    - Execute UAT scenarios based on real-world use cases to ensure the API meets expectations.

## Test Environment
- **Setup**:
    - Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run the API.
    - Access to the GitHub repository hosting the project.
    - Tools: JUnit, RestAssured, Postman.
- **Configuration**:
    - Ensure that all dependencies are correctly installed and configured.
    - Set up test data that mirrors production data for realistic testing scenarios.

## Test Data
- Various combinations of valid and invalid data for:
    - **firstName**: Test with names of different lengths (within and beyond 32 characters), including special characters.
    - **lastName**: Test with names of different lengths (within and beyond 64 characters), including special characters.
    - **email**: Test with valid and invalid email formats, empty fields, and edge cases (e.g., maximum length 255 characters).

## Entry/Exit Criteria

### Entry Criteria
- Test environment is set up and accessible.
- Code is complete, all dependencies are resolved, and all endpoints are accessible.

### Exit Criteria
- All critical and major defects are resolved.
- Test coverage of at least 80% is achieved for all critical components.
- UAT is completed successfully, and stakeholders sign off on test results.

## Defect Management
- **Tool**: Jira.
- **Process**:
    - Log all defects found during testing with detailed information.
    - Categorize defects by severity (Critical, Major, Minor, Trivial).
    - Track the status of each defect until resolution and closure.
    - Regularly review defect reports with the development team to prioritize and fix issues.

## Risk Analysis
- **Potential Risks**:
    - Unavailability of the test environment may delay testing.
    - Incomplete or ambiguous requirements may lead to incorrect testing.
    - Changes in API or codebase during testing could introduce new defects.

- **Mitigation Strategies**:
    - Ensure early and continuous communication with the development team.
    - Maintain a version-controlled environment for managing changes.
    - Regularly review requirements with stakeholders to resolve ambiguities.

## Reporting
- **Frequency**: Daily and Weekly.
- **Content**:
    - Status of tests executed.
    - List of defects identified, fixed, and pending.
    - Test coverage metrics.
    - Any blockers or risks that could impact the testing schedule.

## Conclusion
This test strategy aims to ensure the reliability, functionality, and usability of the API endpoints by covering all key testing types, managing risks effectively, and providing continuous feedback to the development team.
